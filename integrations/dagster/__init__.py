"""Dagster: Dagster run state through its GraphQL API: which runs are in which status, and the failures behind a stale asset.



Two declarations, and discovery walks for both. ``DESCRIPTOR`` is the credential
half — what a credential is made of, which hosts it may reach, how the secret
enters a request, and how to check that it works. ``PROFILE`` is the operational
half — what class of system this is, where it can be reached, what permissions
its capabilities need, and how its endpoints page.
