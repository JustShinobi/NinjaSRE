"""Proves a BigQuery credential works, and proves what it is allowed to do.

Two questions, and the second is the one that costs an hour when it is skipped.
A credential that authenticates can still be scoped without the permission one
capability needs, and that failure surfaces during an incident as a tool error
with no sign that it was knowable at setup time.

So connectivity is one cheap call, each permission is its own cheap call, and
the report names the permission rather than the failure.
