"""Rocket.Chat: A Rocket.Chat channel used for incident response: what has been said, and a finding posted into it.



Two declarations, and discovery walks for both. ``DESCRIPTOR`` is the credential
half — what a credential is made of, which hosts it may reach, how the secret
enters a request, and how to check that it works. ``PROFILE`` is the operational
half — what class of system this is, where it can be reached, what permissions
its capabilities need, and how its endpoints page.
